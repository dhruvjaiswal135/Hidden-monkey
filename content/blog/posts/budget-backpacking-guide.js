    <p>Backpacking on a tight budget is an art form. With smart planning and flexible mindset, you can travel further and experience more than well-funded tourists.</p>

    <h2>Accommodation Hacks</h2>
    <p>Hostels offer the best value with dorm beds costing $5-15 per night. Couchsurfing and house-sitting are free alternatives. Some places offer work-exchange programs where you get free accommodation in exchange for a few hours of work daily.</p>

    <h2>Food on a Budget</h2>
    <p>Eat where locals eat—small family-run restaurants offer authentic food at fraction of tourist prices. Shop at local markets for fruits and snacks. Cook in hostel kitchens with other travelers. Street food is usually cheap and delicious if you choose busy stalls with high turnover.</p>

    <h2>Transportation</h2>
    <p>Use local buses and trains instead of tourist shuttles. Walk when possible—you'll discover hidden gems. Look for early bird or night bus discounts. Multi-day bus passes offer significant savings.</p>

    <h2>Activities and Attractions</h2>
    <p>Many attractions have free or reduced entry days. Visit museums in the evening for discounted rates. Group activities are cheaper than individual tours. Walk through neighborhoods to experience culture without paying entry fees.</p>

    <h2>Money-Saving Strategies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Travel during low season</li>
      <li>Visit cheaper countries (Southeast Asia, India, Central America)</li>
      <li>Stay longer in each place to reduce transport costs</li>
      <li>Join group tours for better rates</li>
      <li>Use travel apps for deals and discounts</li>
      <li>Be flexible with dates and destinations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Backpacker Community</h2>
    <p>Other backpackers are your best resource for budget tips. Share costs by traveling with friends or joining group activities. The hostel community often shares information about cheap eats, free hikes, and hidden attractions.</p>

    <p>Budget backpacking teaches you that experiences matter more than luxury. Some of your best memories will come from unexpected moments and genuine connections with people, not from expensive hotel rooms.</p>
